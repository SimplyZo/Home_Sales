Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Following the data loading, which include handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The notebook ontains cells dedicated to EDA, with a focus of diving into datasets for analysis. 

Through my EDA I explored datapoints for the following questions. 
What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
